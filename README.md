# Raycaster Demo

Dear Levi and Anthony,

Thank you for considering my application for the internship position at Raycaster.ai. I've created this demo project to showcase my technical skills and demonstrate my understanding of Raycaster's mission in revolutionizing AI-powered sales insights.

This full-stack application demonstrates my implementation of a simplified version of Raycaster's core functionality - analyzing company websites to generate actionable insights. Built with modern web technologies, it features real-time collaboration, AI-powered analysis, and robust architecture that I believe aligns well with Raycaster's technical standards.
